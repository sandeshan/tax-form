## Getting Started

### Requirements

**Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine**

```
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd tax-from
npm install
```
Inside the newly created project:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. 

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
